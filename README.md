# CogniBot üß†

A Telegram bot that analyzes messages for cognitive biases, logical fallacies, and discussion quality issues using AI. Designed to foster better discourse and critical thinking in online conversations.

## Features

- **Cognitive Bias Detection**: Identifies confirmation bias, anchoring bias, availability heuristic, and more
- **Logical Fallacy Recognition**: Detects ad hominem, strawman arguments, false dichotomies, etc.
- **Discussion Quality Analysis**: Evaluates reasoning patterns and communication style
- **Educational Responses**: Provides constructive feedback to improve discourse
- **Channel Monitoring**: Automatically analyzes messages in configured channels
- **Manual Analysis**: Use `/analyze` command for immediate text analysis
